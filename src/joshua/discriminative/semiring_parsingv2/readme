Design:

We make two categories: 

(Note: we also tried to create a separate class vector-space.
 This might be useful as it can be combined with any semiring to get a p-module.
 However, we found this is not the case as we need to create many more objects.
 For example, to get a ScalarPM, we need to do sth like "new ScalarPM(new ScalarVS())".
 In terms of number of classes, having a separate vector class does not reduce the workload.)

To compute a new **first-order** statistics, we just need to specify a weight for each hyperedge.
Specifically, we need to implement the following two functions
1. createNewKWeight
2. getEdgeKWeight


To compute a new **second-order** statistics, we just need to specify a weight for each hyperedge.
Specifically, we need to implement the following four functions
1. createNewKWeight
2. createNewXWeight
3. getEdgeKWeight
4. getEdgeXWeight

In either case, we may need to define new semiring, P-module, Bilinear P-module,
and then uses these new classes in implementing the above functions.
