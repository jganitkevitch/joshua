what can we do after we get a hypergraph?

(1) extract stuff from the hypergraph
 - feature extraction
 - oracle extraction
 - confusion extraction
 
 - expectation extraction (for parameter estimation)
 - other decoding extraction (e.g. one/k-best extraction)

(2) transform the hypergraph
 - rerank on the hypergraph
 - split and filter
 - convert it to a lattice
 
(3) applications
 - variational decoding (require feature extraction and rerank)
 - discriminative training (require feature extraction, expectation, and rerank)
 - graphical modeling on a hypergraph
